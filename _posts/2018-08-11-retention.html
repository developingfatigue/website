<p>This week we talk about retention and how companies can keep people in this industry as people are seemingly transient in their jobs. We discuss about some reasons that people might choose to move on in their career. We cover some signs that can help you know when it's time to look for a new job and how good leadership has a large impact on retaining top talent and a couple of ways that leaders can influence people to grow in their career at the company.</p>

<p>Our hosts discuss yet another book by Cal Newport, "So Good They Can't Ignore You". In this book, Cal Newport challenges the idea of "follow your passion" for work that you should do by calling this the "Passion Hypothesis". Kris, Toran, and Brandon discuss this and the other major points of the book, Career Capital and Deliberate practice as they reflect on their career journeys thus far. They also dream about the future and how what they learned from this book could help level up in their career.</p>

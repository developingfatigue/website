<p>This week Toran and Brandon are interviewed by Kris as we learn more about consulting. We talk about the differences between consulting and contracting, why consultants/contractors tend to have a high hourly rate, some of the business and legal aspects of consulting, how to land that first consulting job and ultimately why they left consulting to return to full time employment.</p>

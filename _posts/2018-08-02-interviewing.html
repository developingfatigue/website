<p>In our episode on interviewing, we converse about the good and bad interviews we have had (from the interviewee perspective). We then move on to what we look for when we're conducting interviews and some of the things we wish that people would change about the interview process (take home projects, whiteboards, and questions related to the theoretical part of computer science). We also cover how we prepare for interviews and answers we prepare for commonly asked questions.</p>
